The front page settings are contained in the `_index.md` file which is in the `content` folder. It contains most of the settings needed to be changed in the front page.

All settings in the _index.md file need to be looked through so we won't be separately mentioning what needs changing. There are broadly 8 sections in the front page:

1. Top Banner
2. Showcase
3. About Us
4. Logo Wall
5. Featured Pages
6. Call to Action
7. Reviews
8. Contact

If you see front page of the [demo site](https://template.thinkingtree.me/), you can have a look at the various sections. Each of these can be set on or off. You can heve a detailed look at the options in the section below, based on which you should change your `_index.md` file in the `content` folder.

```toml
# Please use your own images. I provide the code with no implicit or explicit warranties and I am not to be liable for any claim or damages arising from use of this software.

# All options below that are marked with * need to be changed
# There are eight sections in the front page
# 1. Top Banner
# 2. Showcase
# 3. About Us
# 4. Logo Wall
# 5. Featured Pages
# 6. Call to Action
# 7. Reviews
# 8. Contact

# At the outset decide which ones of these you want to use by viewing the preview index page.
# If you don't need any one of these, just set active to false for that section below
# Once you decide you want to have a section, you can change the options for the section.



#* 1. This is the title of the site front page
title = "The Thinking Tree Homepage"

#* 2. These are the popup and sharer options. They are described in more detail in config.toml
show_popup = true
show_sharer = true
rollup_sharer_active = true
fixed_sharer_active = true

# ----------------------------------
# Section 1: Top section
# ----------------------------------
# ----------------------------------
# #
# 1. This is the heading section. Here we use a sliding banner of two images
# 2. The content for the layout can be changed below
# 3. The main fields for rendering the layout are in top_banner.toml in folder 'data/layouts'
# 4. The fields here are rendered by 'render_content_layout_fields.html' which is called by
# #  top_banner.html in homepage-sections
# 5. These fields in 'top_banner.toml' are another (simplified?) way of rendering html.
# 6. One can list multiple slide elements as '[[slide_elements]]'
# 7. For each slide element, one can input styles as '[[slide_elements.styles]]'
# #  with multiple style values as '[[slide_elements.styles.style_value]]'
# #
# #
# 8. We will describe each of the tags in the file top_banner.toml below
# i    name: This has to be unique. It is an identifier of that element. Doesn't go into html
# ii   class & id: These are the class & id of item used in the rendered html.
# iii  content: The actual content for the viewer
# iv   has_children: Decides whether any other elements are rendered within this one
# v    has_parent: true if it is the child of any other element, else false.
# vi   parent: The name of the parent element goes here
# vii  type: Multiple types are there like div -generic html dividor, 'a' for links, etc
# viii slide_elements.styles.media_type: what browser screens to target
# #    https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp
# ix   slide_elements.styles.container: css parent name
# x    slide_elements.styles.target: css target
# #    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp
# xi   [[slide_elements.styles.style_value]]: field (css properties) and value pairs for css
# #    https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/
# xii  [[slide_elements.custom_js_partials]]: Variables for js related to that element
# xiii slide_elements.custom_js_partials.partial_location: Location of js file to load
# xiii slide_elements.custom_js_partials.variable_name: Variables can be passed to above file
# xiv  [[slide_elements.tags]]: Elements of type links ('a') need hrefs passed in the html
# #    These can be passed within tags, which have field and a value. For example:
# xv   slide_elements.tags.field: Can take values like 'href'
# xvi  slide_elements.tags.value: Can take values like 'http://google.com' in example above
# xvii content_field_name: This can be used to replace either "content" or "tags.value"
# #    with a value from another file, which contains the field name and value
# #    For example, one can place 'content_field_name = "link2"' inside 
# #    [[slide_elements.tags]] in top_banner.toml and 
# #    pass link2 from [top_banner.content] in _index.html
# xviiiexternal css sources: One can pass these inside [[slide_elements.css_sources]] 
# #    with an url field
# xix  external js sources: One can pass these inside [[slide_elements.js_sources]]
# #    with an url field, and true/false values for async and defer js sourcing

yourName founded yourCompanyName as a means to work on problems that take time and are more difficult to address than traditional start-ups would allow. Traditionally the distinction between research and production had been fairly well demarcated with research institutions working on technologies that were forward looking and companies working on production oriented technology (technologies which made money today). That distinction has become blurred, especially in computer science with much of the cutting edge improvements happening within companies.

yourCompanyName is an attempt to work on futuristic technologies covering multidisciplinary domains. We follow problems till their origins, dive into rabbit holes and go deep into the root of problems. Many times this leads us to mathematics, which seems to be the foundation of all else. Sometimes it leads to sociology and behavioural science. Few times it leads to the complexity of Biology. Other times it leads to thought experiments. Most of this rests on a backbone of coding as it is ubiquitous as a tool.

The research areas we work on here are network topologies, computational structures, self-organization and automata, idea space theory. Apart from this core, there is also ongoing work on pattern finding in market microstructure (high frequency trading), and a few applications of complexity and modelling. If you would like to join us to contribute on any of these problems, you are most welcome. We're sure you would find the journey at least slightly enlightening. If you have a problem that you would like us to work on, please contact us below.

yourName has been the head of Data Science at Company1 and Company2. At Company1, he built a data science division from scratch which worked on Data Science as a Service - the Company1 data science team acted as the remote data science team for our clients. This meant building tools to solve common problems between companies and building a team to deal with bespoke problems and on demand requests for client companies. At Company2 he was the head of data science and helped in their Series-B fund-raise round.

Prior to that he was a trader on Wall Street trading currency options. During his time at Company3 he helped setup an automated option price trading/monitoring system. On the research side, he worked on single currency fx pricing and eurchf floor failure models. At Company4 he worked on Equity Exotic Options with a specific focus on RFP pricing and generating client ideas. At Company5, he risk managed an exotics trading book. He distinctly remembers being non-plussed at the fuss over the Company5 collapse, having predicted it a year before (Ref: University2 placement talk - 2007). :rocket:'''
