The settings for the contact page http://www.your-domain.com/contact are contained in the `contact.md` file which is in the `content` folder. You can view the sample page [in the demo site](https://template.thinkingtree.me/contact/)

A contact form is a good way for users to contact you and introduces some interactivity to the site. Even if the site is static, we use a third party application called [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) to enable you to setup a contact form.

Make sure **you change email and contact_secondary_email addresses below**

```toml
# (i) The form on this static site is enabled through formspree
#  1.   Setup: Set email ID and secondary_email below the first time you use the contact form
#       you will get a mail asking you to confirm email ID
#
#  2.   Pricing: Free for first 50 emails a month. At some point if this becomes a pain,
#       I'll implement the form layout with some other endpoint
#
#  3.   The layout used is contact.html in layouts/_default folder
#
# Since this template is static, the contact form uses www.formspree.io as a
# middleware proxy. The form makes a POST request to their servers to send the actual email
#
# (ii) Next Steps
#
#  1.   Set your email address under 'email' below
#  2.   You can change the thanks and error messages if you wish
#  2.   Upload the generated site to your server
#  3.   Send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
#  4.   Click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
#  5.   You're done. Happy mailing!
